	   <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Sehwag was born in the family of a grain merchant.[17] He spent his childhood in a joint family with siblings, uncles, aunts and sixteen cousins. Though now settled in New Delhi, the Sehwag family hails from Haryana. Sehwag was the third of four children born to father Krishan and mother Krishna Sehwag, with two older sisters Manju and Anju, and younger brother Vinod. His father attributes his interest in cricket to a toy bat which he was given when he was seven months old. He attended Arora Vidya School in Delhi, and pestered his parents to let him play cricket, on the basis that he was not academically gifted.[18] Early in his career he had a reputation for being an attacking batsman and his coach was coach Amar Nath Sharma.[19] His father tried to end his career when he broke a tooth as a child in 1990, but Sehwag evaded the ban with the help of his mother.[20] Later he attended Jamia Milia Islamia for graduation</p>.
