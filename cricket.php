	 <h3 style="color:red;">Early Domestic Cricket</h3>
	   <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">   Sehwag made his debut for Delhi cricket team in first class cricket in the 1997–98 season. He was selected to the North Zone cricket team for the Duleep Trophy the following 1998–99 season, ending fifth in the total runscoring list.[21] The following year he was fourth on the Duleep Trophy run scoring list, including a 274, the highest score of the competition.[22] This was attained against South Zone at Agartala in just 327 balls, and followed a rapid 187 from just 175 in a Ranji Trophy match against Punjab.[23] He was then selected for the U-19 team which toured South Africa.[18] He was seventh in the 2000–01 season with two centuries,[24] but his consistency earned the attention of selectors and he became a regular member of the national team in mid-2001.

Since his international career started, he has continued to play for Delhi in the domestic competition whilst he is not occupied with international duty and has captained North Zone to victory in the Deodhar Trophy in 2004–05 and 2005–06.[25] He also had a short stint with Leicestershire in county cricket in 2003, but a back injury led to a mutual termination of the contract.[26]</p>.
<h3 style="color:red;">ODI Summary</h3>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Sehwag's scoring rate is extremely quick, at 103.44 runs per 100 balls (it is exceeded only by one current player: Shahid Afridi, who has a much lower average). He has had more success in run chases, scoring seven of his thirteen centuries while chasing. He has led India on seven occasions, due to the unavailability of the incumbent due to illness, injury or rotation policy. In December 2011 Sehwag scored 219 in 149 deliveries against West Indies at Indore. He has the record of 2nd highest individual score</p>   
   <h3 style="color:red;">Test Career</h3>
   <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Sehwag's maiden century in mid-2001 in Sri Lanka was not enough to gain selection in the Test team for the corresponding series.[46] Sehwag made his Test debut in late 2001 in the First Test against South Africa in Bloemfontein as a middle-order batsman. He scored 105 on debut despite the South African win.[47] He was given a one-match suspension by ICC match referee Mike Denness for overappealing[48] in the Second Test in Port Elizabeth, which led to political dispute amongst the ICC and the two countries. He returned for the home series in 2001–02 against England and Zimbabwe. After scoring two half-centuries in the preceding series, he was promoted to a makeshift opener on the 2002 England tour after the failure of previous openers and an experiment with wicket-keeper Deep Dasgupta. He scored 84 in the new role at Lord's[49] and then a century in the Second Test at Trent Bridge,[50] and has batted there in Test matches ever since. He scored his maiden home century of 147 in the First Test against the West Indies in 2002–03 home season in Mumbai, which was at the time his top score in Test matches, earning him his first man of the match award.[51] After a poor tour to New Zealand, he scored passed 50 for the first time in 9 innings when he scored 130 in a Test at Mohali against New Zealand in late 2003</p>
